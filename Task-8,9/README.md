# Task-8 and Task-9

## Frontend and Backend Development

In this task, I faced several challenges as I am new to Next.js and Flask. Time was also limited since I had to learn both.  

For the **Frontend**, I completed most of the work and created the following pages:  
- **Home Page**  
- **Main Page**: This includes a slideshow, a section for the latest movies, and the top 10 movies. Only the movies in the "Latest movies" section can be clicked as the site isn't fully complete yet.  
- **Movie Page**: Displays movie details such as name, description, genre, year, an "Add to Tasklist" button, a text area for reviews, and "Add review" button.  
- **Tasklist Page**: Shows all the movies added to the user's tasklist. This is useful for reviewing movies later.  
- **Login and Signup Pages**: Basic pages for user authentication and gave conditions for Email, Phone number, and Password.  

For the **Backend**, I implemented:  
- **Login, Signup, and Logout**: User details are stored in the database, allowing users to log in. After logging in, a logout button is available for the user to log out of their account.
- **"Add to Tasklist" Functionality**: Adds movies to the user's tasklist.  
- **Adding Reviews**: If a user is logged in, their review appears below the movie with their username. If not, the review is shown as posted by a guest.  

I attempted to implement a feature where each user would have a separate storage for their tasklist but couldn't complete it.
