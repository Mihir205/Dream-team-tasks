# Task-3

In this task, I learned about JavaScript concepts like data types, functions, conditional statements, arrays, and loops. I explored CSS layouts such as Flexbox and CSS Grid and practiced adding and manipulating HTML and CSS through JavaScript. I also deepened my understanding of event handlers, working with Node.js APIs, handling POST and GET requests, and implementing login authentication.
